### Q1) Why sodium bisulfite is used in purification of aldehydes and ketones.
**Ans)** Aldehydes and Ketones form addition compounds with $\ce{NaHSO3}$ whereas impurities do not.
On hydrolysis we get ketones and aldehydes back in their pure form.

### Q2) Di-tert-butyl ketone does not give precipitate with Sodium Bisulfite but acetone does.
**Ans)** In case of acetone, the reaction takes place. However, in case of Di-tertbutyl ketone, **the reaction does not takes place due to steric hindrance(presence of large and bulky alkyl group around carbonyl group)**. This restricts the attack by nucleophile on the carbonyl group and hence no reation takes place.

### Q3) Why is it necessary to control the pH during the reaction of aldehydes and ketones?
**Ans) Because NH3 is a base and if the solution become acidic it can form anilinium ion which is meta directing grpoup** and that is why you cannot get desired product this the fact that it is necessary to control the pH during the reaction of aldehydes and ketones with ammonia derivatives.

### Q4) Why does benzoic acid does not undergo Friedel Krafts reaction?
**Ans)** Benzoic acid does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction due to deactivation of the benzene ring by the electron-withdrawing effect of  $\ce{−COOH}$ group.
The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Aromatic nucleus acts as a nucleophile. Any group that decreases the electron density of aromatic nucleus, will deactivate the ring towards electrophilic aromatic substitution.
