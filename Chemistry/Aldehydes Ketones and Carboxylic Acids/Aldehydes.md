# Name Reactions to prepare aldehydes

- **Ozonolysis**
$\ce{CH_2=CH_2->[{O_3}][{Zn}] 2HCHO + ZnO}$
$\ce{CH_3CH=CHCH_2CH_3->[{O_3}][{Zn}] CH_3-CHO + CH_3CH_2-CHO + ZnO}$

- **Rosenmund's Reaction**
$\ce{ R-COCl ->[{H_2  }][{Pd BaSO^4}] R-CHO}$
 - This reaction also works with $\ce{Ar-COCl}$ 

- **Stephen's Reaction**
$\ce{R-CN ->[{SnCl_2}][{HCl}] RCHNH (Imine)->[{H_3O^+}] R-CHO}$


- **From DiBAl-H**
$\ce{R-CN ->[{DiBAl-H}]  RCHNH (Imine)->[{H_3O^+}] R-CHO}$


- **Etard's Reaction**
$\ce{C_6H_5 - CH_3->[{CrO_2Cl_2}][{CS_2}] C_6H_5 - CH(OCrOHCl_2)_2 ->[{H_3O^+}] C_6H_5 - CHO}$
- $\ce{CS_2}$ is taken to **reduce the reactivity** of $\ce{CrO_2Cl_2}$ , the alternative to $\ce{CrO_2Cl_2}$ is $\ce{CCl_4}$ 
- $\ce{CrO_2Cl_2}$ is a strong oxidising agent , alternative to that is $\ce{CrO_3}$ , also when $\ce{CrO_3}$ is taken , there is no need of **deactivating** agents like $\ce{CS_2}$.
- $\ce{C_6H_5 - CH(OCrClOHCl)_2 }$ is called **etards complex**.

- **Gatterman Koch's Reaction**
$\ce{C_6H_6 ->[{CO, HCl}][{Anhyd. AlCl_3}] C_6H_5 - CHO}$

# Oxidation of Aldehydes
$\ce{CH_3 - CHO ->[{CrO_3}][{[O]}] CH_3COOH}$

$\ce{CH_3 - CO - CH2 -CH3 ->[{CrO_3}][{[O]}] HCOOH + CH_3CH_2COOH}$


# Aldol - Condensation
> Happens due to the presence of alpha - hydrogen

### Process
**Step-1:**
In reverse order, The hydroxide ion deprotonates the aldehyde.

**Step-2:**
Here Enolate ion 1 adds to the unreacted aldehyde.

**Step-3:**
Alkoxide ion 2 is protonated by water.

**Step-4:**
A small amount of aldol is converted into enolate ion (4) by hydroxide ion.

**Step-5:**
Here Enolate Ion(4) loses a hydroxide ion.

> Attacker must have alpha - hydrogen , else the reaction wont progress further , if the reactant may or may not have alpha - hydrogen , the reaction will still progress further because attacker has it ðŸ¥²


# Cannizaro reaction
> Happens due to the absence of alpha - hydrogen

$$\ce{2HCHO ->[{KOH}] HCOOK (potassium formate) + CH3OH (methanol)}$$

**Process**
1. Partial oxidation of $\ce{HCHO}$ happens which gives $\ce{HCOOK+}$
2. Complete reduction of  $\ce{HCHO}$  happens which gives $\ce{CH3OH }$

$$\ce{2C6H5-CHO->[KOH] C6H5-CH2OH (Benzyl alcohol) + C6H5-COOK (potassium benzoate)}$$
