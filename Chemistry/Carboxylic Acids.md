**Proofs for acidic nature of carboxylic acid :-**
1. Polarity of $\ce{O-H}$ bond.
2. Production of $\ce{H2}$ on reaction with metals.
3. Production of salt and water on reaction with bases.

**Carboxylic Acid vs Alcohol**
In Carboxylic Acids ($\ce{CH3 - CO - O - H}$) the polarity of $\ce{O-H}$ bond here is more than that of alcohol ($\ce{CH3 - CH2 - O - H}$) due to the presence of carbonyl group which behaves as an E.W.G. (Electron Withdrawing Group).

**Carboxylic Acid vs Phenol**
Carboyxlic Acids are more acidic then phenol due to the following reasons:-
- Carboxylic acids have two electronegative groups , both oxygen having -ve charge
- None of the resonating structures of carboxylic acids have +ve charge like in the case of phenol.

# Chemical Properties 
1. **Esterification**
$\ce{CH3 - CO - OH + CH3 - CH2 - OH ->[H+][-H2O] CH3 - CO - O - CH2 - CH3}$

2. **Reduction**
$\ce{RCOOH ->[LiAlH4][H+] R - CH2OH}$

3.**Decarboxylation** 
$\ce{RCOOH ->[CaO / NaOH][3 : 1] R-H}$
> CaO and NaOH is in 3:1 ratio and this reaction is also known as **soda lime reaction**

4. **Electrolysis**
$\ce{R - COOH ->[Electricity][H2O] R-CH3}$

5. **Hell Volhard Zelinsky Reaction** 
$\ce{R-COOH + Br2-> BrCH2COOH}$

6. **Phthalimide Formation**
