$$\ce{CI[CA(Ligand)_{CN}]^{charge}CI }$$
**CA (Central Atom)**
It is usually a Lewis acid (deficient of electrons) and a d-block element.
d-block elements are electron deficient and their d-orbital isn't fully filled.

**Ligand**
It is usually a Lewis Base (excess of electrons)

**CN (Coordination Number)**
It is the number of atoms attached to the central atom. It also depends upon the denticity (number of attacking sites) of the atom(s).

**CI (Counter Ion)**
If the coordination entity has negative charge (is anionic) then the CI comes on the left side and is usually a metal (because they donate electrons).
