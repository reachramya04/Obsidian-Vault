$$\ce{CI \underset{\text{coordination entity}}{[CA(Ligand)_{CN}]}^{charge}CI }$$
**Coordination Compounds :**
Coordination compounds are chemical compounds that consist of an array of anions or neutral molecules that are bound to a central atom via coordinate covalent bonds. Coordination compounds are also referred to as coordination complexes. These molecules or ions that are bound to the central atom are referred to as ligands (also known as complexing agents).

**CA (Central Atom)**
It is usually a Lewis acid (deficient of electrons) and a d-block element.
d-block elements are electron deficient and their d-orbital isn't fully filled.

**Ligand**
It is usually a Lewis Base (excess of electrons)

**CN (Coordination Number)**
It is the number of atoms attached to the central atom. It also depends upon the denticity (number of attacking sites) of the atom(s).

**CI (Counter Ion)**
If the coordination entity has negative charge (is anionic) then the CI comes on the left side and is usually a metal (because they donate electrons).
If the coordination entity has positive charge (is cationic) then the CI comes on the right side and is usually a halogen (because they take electrons).

Counter Ion forms ionic bond with the coordination entity and neutralizes the coordination entity.

**Double Salt**
It disassociates into simpler ions  completely when dissolved in water.
Ex : $\ce{KCl.MgCl2.6H2O}$

**Coordination Compound**
It doesn't disassociate into simpler ions completely when dissolved in water.
Ex : $\ce{K4[Fe(CN)6]}$

**Types of Coordination Complex**
- If there is only one type of ligand bounded to the central atom then the complex is called **homoleptic complex**
- If there are two or more types of ligands bounded to the central atom then theh complex is called **heteroleptic complex**

#### Types of Ligands
1. **On the basis of donating sites :**
	1 = Monodentate
	2 = Didentate
	3 = Tridentate
	4 = Tetradentate and so on

2. **Other types of ligands :**
	a) Ambidentate :
				The ligand having two donor sites but it attacks from only one site.
	b) Chelate : 
					Ligands which after getting attacked to a central atom makes the complex stable.


# IUPAC Naming 
**Ligands :** ide , ate oxi is replaced by ido , ato , oxo respectively.

Example:
Cl - Choloro OR Chlorido 
Br - Bromo OR Bromido

For ligands with positive charge : 
	$\ce{NO+}$
	$\ce{NH2NH3^+}$
	$\ce{NO2^+}$

For neutral ligands : 
	$\ce{C6H5N}$
	$\ce{(C6H5)_3P}$
	$\ce{CS}$
	
For ambidentate ligands: 
	$\ce{NO2^-}$
	$\ce{ONO^-}$
