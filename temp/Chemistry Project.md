# Introduction
Iron is one of the widely distributed elements in the nature. One of its striking characteristics is that it undergoes rusting on combining with water, air & carbon-dioxide due to which its surface gets covered with a red brown flake coating called "Rust". Rust is affected by moisture, oxygen & carbon - dioxide. Rust is soft and porous and it gradually falls off from the surface of iron material. It is a continuous process and it gradually eats up iron due to which an iron object loses its strength. It is very wasteful process and should be prevented. It is very-very slow process.


# Theory
When a piece of iron metal is exposed to humid atmosphere, its gets covered with a red brown substance called "Rust". Rusting of iron can be explained on the basis of **electro chemical theory** as follows :

##### **1.** Water vapours on the surface of the metal dissolved carbon-dioxide and oxygen from the air. Thus the surface of metal is covered with the solution of carbon-dioxide with water, i.e. carbonic acid :
$$\ce{\underset{Water}{H2O} + \underset{Carbon Dixoide}{CO2} -> \underset{Carbonic Acid}{H2CO3}}$$
This acts as an electrolytic solution of the cell. The carbonic acid and water dissociate to a small extent as follows:
$$\ce{H2CO3 <-> 2H+ + CO3^2-}$$
$$\ce{H2O <-> H+ + OH-}$$


##### **2.** Iron in contact with the dissolved CO2 and O2 undergoes oxidation as follows :
$$\ce{Fe -> Fe2+ + 2e-}$$
As a result iron is converted into ferrous $\ce{Fe^2+}$ ion.


##### **3.** The electrons lost by iron are taken up by the $\ce{H+}$ ions present on the surface of metal which were produced by the dissociation of $\ce{H2CO3}$ and $\ce{H2O}$. Thus $\ce{H+}$ ions are converted into $\ce{H}$ atoms.
$$\ce{H^+ + e- -> H}$$
Thus H atoms either react with the dissolved oxygen or oxygen from air to from water.
$$\ce{4H + O2 -> 2H2O}$$
The complete reaction may be written as : 
$$\ce{O2 + 4H- + 4e- -> 2H2O}$$
The dissolved oxygen may take up electrons directly to from $\ce{OH-}$ ions as follows :
$$\ce{O2 + 4H2O + 4e- -> 4OH-}$$
The over all reaction of the miniature cell will be :
$$\ce{2Fe(s) + O2(g) + 4H+(aq) -> Fe^2+(aq) + 2H2O(l)}$$


##### **4.** The ferrous ions formed react with the dissolved oxygen or oxygen from air to from ferric oxide as follows:
$$\ce{4Fe^2+ + O2 + 4H2O -> 2Fe2O3 + 8H+(aq)}$$
Ferric oxide then undergoes hydration to form Rust as follows :
$$\ce{\underset{Ferric Oxide}{Fe2O3} + xH2O -> \underset{Hydrated Ferric Oxide (Rust)}{Fe2O3xH2O}}$$
