# Goals for sustainable development 
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

### No Poverty
#### Current Situation
- Covid-19 has led to the first rise in extreme poverty in a generation.
- An additional 119-124 million people were pushed back into extreme poverty in 2020.
- The global poverty rate is projected to be 7% in 2030.

### Zero Hunger
End Hunger, Achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agirculture
#### Current Situation
- The global pandemic is exacerbating world hunger.
- Wordlwide , an additional 70 - 161 million people are likely to have experienced hunger as a result of the pandemic in 2020.
-  Pandemic will worsen child malnutrition. 
- 2.37 billion people are without food or unable to eat a healthy balanced on a regular basis.

### Good health and well-being 
 Ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all at all ages.
 #### Current Situation
- The pandemic has halted or reversed progress in health and shortened life expectancy.
- 90% of countries are still reporting one or more disruptions to essential health services.
- A lack of data hinders understanding of the true impact of covid-19.
- Scaling up investment in universal health coverage is essential.

### Quality Education
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
 #### Current Situation
 - Covid-19 has wiped out 20 years of education gains.
 - An additional 101 million or 9% of children in grades 1 through 8 fell below minimum reading proficiency levels in 2020
 - Participation in organized pre-primary learning increased from 65% in 2010 to 73% in 2019.
 - Slow progress in school completion is likely to get worse
 - Basic school infrastructure to build back better is lacking in many countries.
 
### Clean water and Sanitation 
Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
#### Current Situation 
- Billions of people still lack access to safe drinking water , sanitation and hygiene 
- 2.3 Billion people live in water-stressed countries 
- Between 1970 and 2015 natural wetlands shrank by 35%.
- 129 countries are not on track to have sustainably managed water resources by 2030.

### Affordable and Clean Energy
Ensure access to affordable reliable , sustainable and modern energy for all.
 #### Current Situation
 - One third of the world's population use dangerous and efficient cooking systems.
 - 759 million people lack access to electricity.
 - 3 out of 4 of them live in sub-saharan africa.
 - Energy efficiency improvement rate needs acceleration.
 - Accelerated action on modern renewable energy is needed especially in heating and transport sectors.


# Needs For Sustainable Development 
Sustainable development is a hard topic to nail down because it consists of a wide range of things. Due to the technicality and complexity of this topic, it’s best to check out its importance holistically to be able to grasp it easily.

The population is the main factor driving up sustainable development campaigns. So, the importance of sustainable development can be viewed from this perspective:

### 1. Provides Essential Human Needs
The explosion of population means people will have to scramble for the limited life essentials like food, shelter, and water. Adequate provision of these basic needs almost entirely hinges on infrastructure capable of sustaining them for a long time.

If governments insist on utilizing fossil fuel-based sources of energy instead of renewable and sustainable options, the cost and [environmental effects](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-and-effects-of-environmental-degradation.php) of supplying these basic needs would become a tall order.

### 2. Agricultural Requirement
A [growing population](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-effects-solutions-of-overpopulation.php) means agriculture must catch up. Finding ways to feed more than 3 billion people can be staggering. If the same unsustainable cultivation, planting, irrigation, spraying, and harvesting techniques are utilized in the future, they might prove to be financially burdening considering fossil fuel resources are projected to run out.

Sustainable development [focuses on sustainable agricultural methods](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/methods-and-benefits-of-sustainable-agriculture.php) such as effective seeding techniques and crop rotation to promote high yields while maintaining the integrity of the soil, which produces food for a large population.

### 3. Manage Climate Change
Climate change can be mitigated by [sustainable development practices](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/sustainable-practices-waste-management.php). Sustainable development practices seek to reduce the use of [fossil-based sources](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/pros-and-cons-of-fossil-fuels.php) of fuel like oil, natural gas, and coal. Fossil fuel sources of energy are unsustainable since they will deplete in the future and are responsible for the emission of greenhouse gasses.

### 4. Financial Stability
Sustainable development practices have the ability to create more financially sustainable economies across the globe. Developing countries that can’t access [fossil fuels](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/fossilfuels.php) can leverage renewable forms of energy to power their economies.

From the development of renewable energy technologies, these countries can create sustainable jobs as opposed to finite jobs based on [fossil fuel](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/coalasfossilfuel.php) technologies.

### 5. Sustain Biodiversity
Unsustainable development and overconsumption practices greatly impact [biodiversity](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/35-wonderful-ways-to-protect-biodiversity-that-you-need-to-know-today.php). The life ecosystem is designed in such a way that species depend on one another for survival. For instance, plants produce oxygen that humans need for respiration.

Humans exhale carbon dioxide that [plants need for growth](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/study-cigarette-butts-serious-harm-environment-hindering-plant-growth.php) and production. Unsustainable development practices like emission of [greenhouse gasses](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/greenhouse-gases.php) in the atmosphere kill many plant species resulting in the reduction of atmospheric oxygen.

This is not good for humans. Sustainable development practices encourage the use of renewable energy resources and [organic farming practices](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/organic-farming-need-and-features.php) that do not emit any greenhouse gas to the atmosphere.
