### 11 : 30PM
Woke up around 8:30AM , couldnt sleep last night till 1 or 1 : 30AM.

Trying to change routine from now on.
Brain becomes hyper-active during night time.
Will start studying again today , I hope everything goes well.

There are no significant improvements in meditation.
I feel like I have lost the touch which I used to have before. That most probably will change when I wake up early and start meditating again.

Mom and Dad had no arguments today , which is good I believe. Didnt get breakfast today. Mum is fasting today.
