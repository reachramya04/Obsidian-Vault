# Rational Numbers
Any number which can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$ is called a rational number where both **p** and **q** are **integers**.
The better way to represent a rational number is to ensure that $\gcd(p,q)=1$ so that
the fraction is not repeated.
This way of representing rational numbers where the $\gcd(p,q) = 0$ is called the **reduced form**.  
$\gcd$ = **greatest common divisor**

## Density 
### Integers 
For every integer $m$ there exists its predecssor $m-1$ and its successor $m+1$
