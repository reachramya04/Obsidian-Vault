## Distance Formula
$$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = Distance$$
If the distance between 2 points is 0 then that means they are the same point.


## Section Formula 
Suppose a point $A(x,y)$ lies on the line formed by the 2 points $P(x_1 , y_1)$ and $Q(x_2 , y_2)$
and point $A$ divides the line in the ratio of $m : n$.

Then,
$$x = \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}$$
and 
$$y = \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n}$$

When the points are given but ratio of $m:n$ is not given then,
take $m:n$ = $k:1$.
