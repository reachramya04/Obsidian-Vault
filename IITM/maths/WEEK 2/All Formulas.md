## Distance Formula
$$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = Distance$$
If the distance between 2 points is 0 then that means they are the same point.


## Section Formula 
Suppose a point $A(x,y)$ lies on the line formed by the 2 points $P(x_1 , y_1)$ and $Q(x_2 , y_2)$
and point $A$ divides the line in the ratio of $m : n$.

Then,
$$x = \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}$$
and 
$$y = \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n}$$

When the points are given but ratio of $m:n$ is not given then,
take $m:n$ = $k:1$.


## Area of Triangle
If a triangle is formed by 3 points $A(x_1,y_1)$ , $B(x_2,y_2)$ and $C(x_3,y_3)$ ,
then the area of the triangle formed will be ,

$$Area = \frac{1}{2}|x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|$$
If the area of the triangle is 0 then that means the points $A$ , $B$ and $C$ are collinear i.e. they all lie on the same line.


## Slope of Line
$$m = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} =\tan \theta$$
where $\theta$ is measured in anti-clockwise direction with respect to X axis.

For a line parallel to Y-axis or perpendicular to X-axis , the slope becomes not defined as 
$\tan90 = 1/0$.
For a line parallel to X-axis or perpendicular to Y-axis , the slope becomes 0 as $\tan0 = 0$.
