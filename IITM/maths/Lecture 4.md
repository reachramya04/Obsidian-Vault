# Set Theory 
* A set is a collection of items.
Example :- 
$\{$ 1,2,3,4,5,6$\}$
$\{$Sunday , Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday$\}$

* Sets can be both finite and infinite
* Duplicate items are not considered in a set and the items have no order.
* Cardinality  is the number of items in a set.
* Not every collection of items is a set.


## Elements
Items in a set are called elements. Elements of a set can be a set itself.
They are represented by,
$x \in Y$ , here $x$ is the element which belongs to set $Y$.
Example : $2 \in \mathbb{N}$

When an element is not a part of a set it is written as $x \notin Y$ .
Example : $\sqrt{5} \notin \mathbb{N}$


## Subset
* If a set is included in another set , its called a subset. Every element of a subset is a part of the set it belongs to.
* Example :  $\mathbb{Q}$ is included in  $\mathbb{R}$. (Integers are a part of real numbers)

* Subsets are represented using the following notation, 
$$\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$$
 * Every set is a subset of itself i.e. $X \in X$
 * Equal sets i.e. $X = Y$ can be represented as $X \subseteq Y$.


## Empty Set and Powerset
### Empty Set
* Empty Set is represented as $\emptyset$.
* Empty is a subset for every set i.e. $\emptyset \in Y$ , where $Y$ is any other set.

### Power Set 
* It is the set of subsets of a set. 
* Any finite set having an **n** number of elements has , $2^n$ elements in its powerset and $2^n$ subsets of itself.
