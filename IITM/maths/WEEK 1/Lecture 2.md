# Rational Numbers
Any number which can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$ is called a rational number where both **p** and **q** are **integers**.
The better way to represent a rational number is to ensure that $\gcd(p,q)=1$ so that
the fraction is not repeated.
This way of representing rational numbers where the $\gcd(p,q) = 0$ is called the **reduced form**.  
$\gcd$ = **greatest common divisor**

## Density 
### Integers 
For every integer $m$ there exists its predecssor $m-1$ and its successor $m+1$ such that there is no other integer in between. 
**Integers are discerete.**

### Rational Numbers 
**Rational Numbers are dense** and there always exists another rational number between 2 rational numbers.
**Example:-**
$$
(\frac{m}{n} + \frac{p}{q})/2 = \frac{a}{b}
$$
$\frac{a}{b}$ is the average of the 2 rational numbers.
There always exists a rational number in between.
For **0.1** and **0.5** , there exists **0.25**  in between them,
in between **0.1** and **0.25** there exists **0.125** which is the average of both the numbers.
Hence, it keeps going on.
