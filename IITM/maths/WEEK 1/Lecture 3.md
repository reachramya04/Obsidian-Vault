# Real and Complex Numbers 
* Numbers which cannot be represented in the form of $\frac{p}{q}$ are called Irrational Numbers.
* Irrational numbers  like $\sqrt{2}$ can be drawn , but they can't represented on number line. 
* Irrational numbers are typically square roots of integers that are not perfect squares.
* $\mathbb{R}$ **represents** the set of **Real numbers** which is **composed of** $\mathbb{Q}$ (**Rational** Numbers) and **Irrational** numbers.

## Density 
Just like Rational Numbers , **Real Numbers are dense** because there always exists another  number between any 2 of them such that,

If $r < r'$ , then $\frac{(r + r')}{2}$ lies between $r$ and $r'$
