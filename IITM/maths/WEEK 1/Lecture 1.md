# Natural Numbers And Their Operations

## Natural Numbers 
It is the set of numbers which go on from 1 to infinity.
It does not include rational and irrational numbers.

$N_0$ is used to depict the inclusion of 0 in set of natural numbers.

$$\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0,1,2,3 ...\}$$
## Mathematical Operations 
### Subtraction 
We get both natural and not natural numbers when using this operator.
Subtraction generates a set of integers.
$$\mathbb{Z} = \{... -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 ...\}$$
### Addition
Addition returns a natural number which belongs to the set of natural numbers. 

### Multiplication
Its repeated addition so it also returns numbers which belong to set of natural numbers.

### Division
It gives both natural numbers and rational numbers.
When there's a remainder then the equation is written as :- 
$$\begin{align}
19 \mod{5} = 4 \\
5 \ | \ 19 = 4
\end{align}$$
if $a \ | \ b = 0$ then it is written as just $a \ | \ b$ .
**Example:-**
$$4 \mid 5$$
Also if $a \mod{b}$ has a remainder then it can be written as $a \ \nmid \ b$
**Example:-**
$$4 \nmid 19$$

## Factors 
If there's a number which is not a perfect square then number of factors will always be even.
**Example:-** 
$$
15 = \{\{1 , 15 \} , \ \{ 3 , 5\}\}
$$
Here **15** has 4 factors  which is even as its not a perfect square. 
Whereas, 

$$25 = \{ \{1,25\} , \ \{5\}\}$$
(Duplicate items are not counted in sets)
**25** has 3 factors as it as  perfect square. 

### Prime Numbers 
Prime Numbers only have 2 factors , which is 1 and the number itself.
**Example:-**
$$
\begin{align}
5 = \{1,5\} \\
2 = \{1,2\}
\end{align}
$$
Every number can be written as the product of prime numbers , this is called prime factorization.
