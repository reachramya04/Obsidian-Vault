# Natural Numbers And Their Operations

## Natural Numbers 
It is the set of numbers which go on from 1 to infinity.
It does not include rational and irrational numbers.

$N_0$ is used to depict the inclusion of 0 in set of natural numbers.

$$\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0,1,2,3 ...\}$$
## Mathematical Operations 
### Subtraction 
We get both natural and not natural numbers when using this operator.
Subtraction generates a set of integers.
$$\mathbb{Z} = \{... -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 ...\}$$
### Addition
Addition returns a natural number which belongs to the set of natural numbers. 

### Multiplication
Its repeated addition so it also returns numbers which belong to set of natural numbers.

### Division
It gives both natural numbers and rational numbers.
When there's a remainder then the equation is written as :- 
$$\begin{align}
19 \mod{5} = 4 \\
5 \ | \ 19 = 4
\end{align}$$
