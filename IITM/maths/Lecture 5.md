# Construction of Subsets and Set Comprehension


## Constructing Subsets 
$$\{ \ x \ | \ x \in \mathbb{Z} \ , \ x \ mod \ 2 = 0\}$$
The set above represents even integers and this way of representing sets is called set comprehension.

### Steps of constructing subsets through Set Comprehension
* Begin with an existing set , $\mathbb{Z}$
* Apply a condition on to each element in that set where $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ , such that $x \mod{2}=0$
* Collect all the items which satisfy that condition.

**Examples:**
* Set of odd natural numbers, $\{ \ x \ | \ x \in \mathbb{N} \ , \ x \ mod \ 2 \neq 0\}$
* Set of rationals in reduced form ,  $\{ \frac{p}{q} \ | \ p,q \in \mathbb{Z} \ , \ \gcd(p,q)=1 \}$
