# Introduction and Types of Data 


## Major Branches of Statistics
Statistics can be broadly categorised into 2 branches.

### Descriptive Statistics 
The part of statistics concerned with the description and summarization of data is called descriptive statistics.

It is when the data is analysed and no conclusion or prediction is done using the data.
It is always performed on the [[Lecture 1#Population|Population]].
**Example:** Average house price in North Delhi.

### Inferential Statistics 
The part of statistics concerned with the drawing of conclusion from data is called inferential statistics.

It is when the data is used to predict the future or draw a conclusion. 
It can be performed on either the [[Lecture 1#Population|Population]] or the [[Lecture 1#Sample|Sample]] There is always factor of chance/probability.
The data taken from the population to form a sample must always be randomized and representative of the whole population.
**Example:** Predicting the monthly sales of a product on data collected from past 3 years.


## Population and Sample
### Population 
The total collection of all elements we are interested in is called the population.
It is the universal set or the whole data taken.

### Sample 
A subgroup of the population that will be studied in detail is called the sample.
It is the subset or randomly collected records from the whole data taken.

**Example:** The percentage of all the students  in India who end up in jobs they wished to do. 
Such tasks are very hard to perform because of the population and geographical conditions of India.
So to get a overall feel , a sample from the whole population is taken.
It can be 1 lakh students all over India or 1 crore , but the data in the subset must be randomized i.e. order of choosing students from all over India must be randomized to get better results.
Here Students all over India is the population and the randomly selected students are the sample.

The conclusions drawn from a sample are not always valid.
