# Classification of Data 
## Categorical Data 
Categorical data is a collection of information that is divided into groups.
It is also known as qualitative variables.

Categorical data can take on numerical values (such as “1” indicating Yes and “2” indicating No), but those numbers don’t have mathematical meaning. One can neither add them together nor subtract them from each other.
**Arithmetic cannot be performed** on categorical data.

Categorical data values can sometimes be compared to each other (>,<,=).
**Example:** Educational Qualifications , Gender


## Numerical Data 
Numerical data is a data type expressed in numbers, rather than natural language description. 
It is also known as quantitative data.
The data that make up a numerical variable in data table must share a common unit.

Numerical data is always collected in number form and **arithmetic operations can be performed** on numerical data.
**Example:** Marks scored by students, Weight of Bags 

There are 2 subtypes of Numerical Data :- 

### Discrete Data 
Discrete Data represents countable items and can take both numerical and categorical forms.
It is always quantised i.e. there is a fixed interval between each value.
**Example**: Integers , as there is no integer between 1 and 2.
Number of steps walked from point A to point B.

### Continuous Data 
This is a type of numerical data which represents measurements.
It may or may not be in decimal datatype.
It is not quantised and can have any value within a range.
**Example:** Rational Numbers , there is always a rational number between 2.
Weight of people in a locality , CGPA of students.


## Time-Series Data 
Its the data recorded over time.
This data typically consist of successive measurements made from a point of time.
It is used to track change over time.

If the value of time keeps changing within a table then its a time-series data.
**Example:** Percentage of students who passed from 2015-2020.


## Cross-Sectional Data 
Its the data observed over a period of time.
It is used to track changes in different subjects at some point of time.

If the value of time doesn't change within a table then its cross sectional data.
 **Example:** Number of people who went to delhi on 10 January.
