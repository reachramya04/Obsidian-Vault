# Scales of Measurements 
## Nominal Scale 
When the data for a variable consists of labels or names used to identify the characteristic or observation, the scale of measurements is considered nominal scale measurements.

There is no order between nominal scales.
Sometimes nominal variables might be numerically coded like in the case of jersey numbers.
**Example:** Gender , Names , Jersey Numbers 


## Ordinal Scale
It exhibits properties from nominal scale but there is an order between values and they can be compared to each other.

The difference/interval between the values is not defined/fixed.
Sometimes  ordinal variables might be numerically coded like in the case of ratings , like a 4 star rating.
**Example:** Ranks , Grades , Ratings
A resturaunt with 2 star rating is not half bad as a resturaunt with 4 star rating.


## Interval Scale
It exhibits properties from ordinal scale but the difference/interval between the values is defined/fixed.

Interval data is always numeric . Difference between any 2 values can be found out.
Ratios have no meaning in interval scale as there is no absolute zero.
Only addition and subtraction can be done.
**Example:** Temperature , Measure of Sounds


## Ratio Scale 
It exhibits the properties of interval scale but there is an absolute zero and ratio can be found out. It is generally used for measurements.

Multiplication and Division can also be done.
**Example:** Marks , Average goals scored ,weight
